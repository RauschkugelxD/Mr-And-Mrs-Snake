# Mr And Mrs Snake

This is a 3D implementation of the classic computer game SNAKE for Android and iOS. It's just supposed to be a showcase of a student project of mine, so it's a very simple version without any obstacles on the field or changes in speed etc.

Check out the game by downloading the apk :) 

### Controls
The snake can be moved in all directions using a joystick on the left side and the camera can be rotated with a (unvisible) touch field on the right side.

### Tech Details
The game was made with Unity 2020.3.7f1 and the 3D models got modeled in Blender 2.92.0. 
I created different characters so that the player can literally choose different skins in the game. Feel free to download the 3D models on Sketchfab: https://skfb.ly/onN7T
